Average RPM,10042.9 RPM,9038.6 RPM,10%,17.71%,14.61 kg,0.400s,22.00s,0.664 kg/s,"Aggressive short-shifting, upshift 2000 RPM early",Risk losing exit speed on slower corners
Average RPM,10042.9 RPM,9540.7 RPM,5%,8.86%,7.31 kg,0.150s,8.25s,0.886 kg/s,"Short-shift by 1000 RPM, avoid redline",Good low-end torque - short-shifting effective
Average Speed,200.2 km/h,180.2 km/h,10%,7.70%,6.36 kg,1.250s,68.75s,0.092 kg/s,Significant speed reduction (major time loss),Last resort - significant competitiveness impact
Average Throttle,64.0 %,57.6 %,10%,6.82%,5.63 kg,0.500s,27.50s,0.205 kg/s,"Lift & coast before braking, reduce peak throttle",May affect tire temps - monitor closely
Average Speed,200.2 km/h,190.2 km/h,5%,3.85%,3.18 kg,0.550s,30.25s,0.105 kg/s,Moderate lift in high-speed corners,Consider trade-off with tire deg on long stints
Average Gear,5.2 ,4.7 ,10%,3.76%,3.10 kg,0.650s,35.75s,0.087 kg/s,Significant gear changes (affects driveability),Check with driver comfort - major change
Average RPM,10042.9 RPM,9842.0 RPM,2%,3.54%,2.92 kg,0.055s,3.02s,0.966 kg/s,Short-shift by 500 RPM,Mercedes PU optimal torque curve allows early shifts
Average Throttle,64.0 %,60.8 %,5%,3.41%,2.81 kg,0.200s,11.00s,0.256 kg/s,"Smooth throttle application, avoid aggressive inputs",AMR23/24 has good aero - can coast more
Average Gear,5.2 ,4.9 ,5%,1.88%,1.55 kg,0.225s,12.38s,0.125 kg/s,Skip gears where possible,May feel unnatural for driver - practice needed
Average Speed,200.2 km/h,196.2 km/h,2%,1.54%,1.27 kg,0.200s,11.00s,0.116 kg/s,Slightly conservative corner entries,AMR aero efficiency helps maintain speed with less throttle
Average Throttle,64.0 %,62.7 %,2%,1.36%,1.13 kg,0.075s,4.12s,0.273 kg/s,Lift 50m earlier in braking zones,Mercedes PU responds well to smooth inputs
Average Gear,5.2 ,5.1 ,2%,0.75%,0.62 kg,0.075s,4.12s,0.151 kg/s,Use higher gear in slow corners,Use 8-speed gearbox efficiency
